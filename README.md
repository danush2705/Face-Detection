# Real-Time Face Recognition with Pose Detection

This Python script uses OpenCV for real-time face recognition and MediaPipe for pose detection.

## Installation

1. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python face-recognition mediapipe
    ```

2. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/danush2705/Face-Detection/tree/d8e331d0d736b62bc7fb3179f073cacef6eb4bae/Face%20detection
    ```

3. Navigate to the repository folder:
    ```bash
    cd face-detection
    ```

4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python Face_with_skeleton.py
    python Face_without_skeleton.py
    ```
